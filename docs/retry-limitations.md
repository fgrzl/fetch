# Retry Middleware - Implementation Notes

The retry middleware implementation demonstrates retry functionality but has architectural limitations due to the response middleware pattern.

## Limitations

### 1. Response Middleware Pattern Issues

- Response middleware operates on already-completed responses
- Cannot modify the original request context (body, headers, method)
- Limited to simple URL-based retries
- Cannot preserve request authentication or complex payloads

### 2. Test Failures Analysis

The retry tests fail because:

- **Timing Issues**: Response middleware can't properly control the fetch timing
- **Mock Limitations**: Vitest mocks don't interact well with the recursive retry pattern
- **Architectural Mismatch**: Retries need request-level control, not response-level

### 3. Production Considerations

For production retry logic, consider:

- **Request Middleware**: Implement retries before the fetch call
- **Client-Level Integration**: Build retry logic into the core fetch client
- **Dedicated Libraries**: Use proven libraries like `retry` or `p-retry`

## Current Implementation

The current implementation is a proof-of-concept that:
✅ Demonstrates retry configuration patterns
✅ Shows different backoff strategies
✅ Provides proper TypeScript interfaces
❌ Cannot reliably retry complex requests
❌ Has timing and testing issues
❌ Limited to GET requests effectively

## Recommended Approach

For full retry functionality, implement at the client level:

```typescript
class FetchClient {
  async fetchWithRetry(url: string, options: RequestInit & RetryOptions) {
    // Implement retry logic here with full request context
    // This approach has access to original request details
  }
}
```

This would allow proper retry handling with preserved request context.
